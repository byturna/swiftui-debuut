# What the fuck is this?
I wanted to learn how to code, thought SwiftUI would be similar to Bootstrap for HTML. Turns out it kinda is... maybe?

I didn't know what to make so I just started making a package manager similar to Cydia.

# TODO

 - [ ] Add profile button to Home page - ~~Similar to the App Store~~.
       GitHub iOS app has a better Navbar (but with modal instead
       *(maybe)*).
 - [ ] Give 'Add-ons' disclosure menu an icon like all the other
       categories.
 - [ ] Remove the other 'Add-ons' categories.
 - [x] ~~Add an edit (or settings) button on Categories page.~~
 - [ ] ~~Make a Search page~~ Make a **better** Search page.
 - [ ] Make Home page prettier, add some other options maybe?
