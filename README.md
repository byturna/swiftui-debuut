# What the fuck is this?
I wanted to learn how to code, thought SwiftUI would be similar to Bootstrap for HTML. Turns out it kinda is... maybe?

I didn't know what to make so I just started making a package manager similar to Cydia.

# TODO
1. Add profile button to Home page - Similar to the App Store.
2. Give 'Add-ons' disclosure menu an icon like all the other categories.
3. Remove the other 'Add-ons' categories.
4. Add an edit (or settings) button on Categories page.
5. Make a Search page
6. 
7.
